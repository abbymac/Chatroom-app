## Chatroom App

### Usage

1. Clone repo
2. install dependencies
3. run npm start in server folder
4. run yarn start in client folder
5. go to localhost:3000
6. open new tabs to add different users

### Design

Two pages: login screen and chatroom screen. User logs in by specifying a username and chatroom name. If chatroom is already in use, then user enters existing chatroom. If chatroom is new, then user enters empty chatroom. Opening new tabs to localhost:3000 simulates multiple users. When a 'new' user enters an existing chatroom, the other occupants are alerted by the admin.
